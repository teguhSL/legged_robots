\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The purpose of this report is to present the modelling, simulation, and control of a simplified humanoid robot walking model. The report is divided into two parts. The first presents the kinematics and dynamics analysis of the walking model, the impact map, the numerical integration for simulation, and the standard controller. The second part then presents the proposed controller using an optimal control approach. The first part uses matlab, while python + CasADi are used for the second part.
